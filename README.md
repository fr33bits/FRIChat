# FRIChat

Instant messaging service meant for communications in business and organizational settings. The client is built using React and hosted on GitHub Pages ([https://fr33bits.github.io/FRIChat/](https://fr33bits.github.io/FRIChat/)), while the backend uses a node.js server running on an OnRender instance and uses the [Stream API](https://getstream.io/chat/) for backend storage and management.
